CSGT-Cosmology: Information-Geometric Attractor TheoryVer 2.1 - Theorem 1.5 Unified Attractor StructureThis repository contains the mathematical framework and numerical verification for Cosmic Self-Generating Theory (CSGT). CSGT provides a geometric resolution to the Hubble Tension ($H_0$ tension) by deriving cosmic expansion directly from an information-preserving invariant, rather than empirical fits.🏛️ Theoretical Core: Theorem 1.5At the heart of CSGT is the Information-Geodesic Attractor Theorem. It postulates that the universe obeys a fundamental conservation law of information $\frac{d\mathcal{F}}{dt} = 0$, which constrains the Hubble evolution $H(z)$ to a unique stable manifold.The CSGT ConditionFor any physically consistent cosmology, the logarithmic derivative of the Hubble parameter $y(z) \equiv \frac{d}{dz}\ln H(z)$ must satisfy:$$\boxed{y'(z) + y(z)^2 = 0}$$Key ResultsUnique Attractor: The universe follows a single stable trajectory that connects the high-redshift CMB regime to the local low-redshift measurements.Natural Emergence of $H_0 \approx 73$: Unlike $\Lambda$CDM, which treats $H_0$ as a free parameter, CSGT identifies $H_0 \approx 73 \text{ km s}^{-1}\text{Mpc}^{-1}$ as a mathematical eigenvalue required for information stability.The $z \approx 0.7$ Phase Shift: The "Hubble Tension" is identified as a projection effect occurring near the information-geometric critical point $z \approx 0.7$.📉 Visualizing the Deviation (Incompatibility Norm)The repository provides tools to calculate the Incompatibility Norm $\mathcal{R}(z)$, which measures how much a given model violates the laws of information preservation.CSGT: $\mathcal{R}(z) \equiv 0$ (Perfectly consistent)$\Lambda$CDM: $\mathcal{R}(z) \gg 0$, peaking at $z \approx 0.7$The $H_0$ tension is not a measurement error; it is the physical manifestation of $\Lambda$CDM's structural failure to preserve cosmic information.🚀 ContentsTheorem1.5.pdf: Formal proof and mathematical derivation.Simulation/: Python scripts for phase space analysis and attractor visualization.Data/: Comparison against Pantheon+ and DESI datasets.⚖️ LicenseThis project is licensed under the MIT License - see the LICENSE file for details.
